# House Bot üè†

Personal project that aggregates Czech property sites and reports on new/modified listings of properties and propagates these changes to a discord channel.

## Dependencies
Node v20+   
CLI     

## Usage
Clone the repo     
Install dependencies with npm i     
For discord populate env with DISCORD_TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID and set up a Webhook for the given CHANNEL_ID
If you would like routing options, set up a GOOGLE_APIKEY env variable with your Maps API key   
In config.json provide URLs and GraphQL API params to call upon desired listings in each site     
Sreality can often fail to fetch listings due to IP throttling, if you wish to use proxies, insert your IPs into proxies.json and PROXY_USERNAME & PROXY_PASSWORD into .env     
Execute npm run start   

## To-Do

- Fix listing status tags 
- Consider individual listings crawling for details
- Look into limiting Maps API calls to not exceed Free Tier ‚úîÔ∏è  
- Implement proxies to scrape Sreality due to IP throttling
