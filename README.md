# House Bot üè†

Personal project that aggregates Czech property sites and reports on new/modified listings of properties and propagates these changes to a discord channel.

## Dependencies
Node v20+   
CLI     

## Usage
Clone the repo     
Install dependencies with npm i     
For discord populate env with DISCORD_TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID and set up a Webhook for the given CHANNEL_ID    
If you would like routing options, set up a GOOGLE_APIKEY env variable with your Maps API key   
In config.json provide URLs and GraphQL API params to call upon desired listings in each site     
Execute npm run start   

## To-Do

- Consider parsing square meterage and adding a comparison against average prices in the region     
- Debug listing status tags (None are marked as Repost either due to bug or unique ID for posts or too small of a sample size)      
- Consider individual listings crawling for details
